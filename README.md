# CS50-Mario-More

Recreates the double half-pyramid from Super Mario Bros. based on a user-chosen height.

🧱 Description

The program asks the user to input a height between 1 and 8, inclusive.
It then prints two aligned half-pyramids made of # characters, separated by two spaces.

This is a classic CS50 problem that emphasizes loops, input validation, and formatted output.

## ✅ Example Output

If the user enters a height of **4**, the program prints:

```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```
